Easy Donate is a Android application to connect Donors and Donees in a single place.

Unlike other applications, Easy Donate is free and open source.  
It enables the communication between the people who have with those who don't, making it possible to wave down the difficulties during calamities and pandemics.

Our app is an open-source project. You can inspect, modify and enhance to improvise the app, making it a yet more powerful and viable application.
Contributions are welcome!

 ## About

Easy Donate lets you donate and seek help with ease. It is a platform to connect people who are happy to contribute and people who are in need. Any aid or donation, no matter how small, will be deeply appreciated.

You can create requests for things like clothes, food, furniture, etcetera. Once you are done, your requests will be posted in the forum, and volunteering donors will be able to contact you.

If you are willing to donate, you are most welcome to create a donation post mentioning the details of your items. People in need can approach you directly.

The posts will be public so that the donors and donees can view the requests and donations and contact them accordingly.
